# My dotfiles

My current config for 
- shell (bashrc.d copied from qmacro)
- minimal neovim and tmux
- aerospace with sketchybar and jankyborders

Note: After cloning the repo, execute the dotsetup script to start the configuration. This script creates some sym-links in the home directory to refer to the actual rc files in the dotfiles directory.
Also, install ```batcat``` for better and colorful preview in ```lf``` file manager
