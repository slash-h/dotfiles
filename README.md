# My dotfiles

These are qmacro's dotfiles, configuration and settings which I stole and modified some files / scripts for my purpose. Thanks qmacro :)

Note: After coming the repo, execute the dotsetup script to start the configuration. This script creates some sym-links in the home directory to refer to the actual rc files in the dotfiles directory.
